## Dataset

> This data set includes ride of 870,174 individuals, covering the San Francisco Bay area. This complete yearly data can be found and downloaded on Baywheels website https://s3.amazonaws.com/baywheels-data/index.html. 
> For this analysis I have downloaded the first four months in 2019,making up a quarter of the year. The attributes were cleaned from 15 to 10.  This includes the start and end time of each bike trip, the gender of riders, the age of riders, duration of each trip, the location each trip started and the location it ended. And finally a categorical attributes that checks whether a bike user is a subscriber or a customer of the system. 


## Summary of Findings

> A lot of the bikes rides are covered in short minutes, the average trips takes around 500 - 550 seconds. The age disparity and the duration of trips shows that younger people takes shorter trips compared to older people. 
The category user type shows that a over 80% of riders are subscribers as compared to nearly 20% of customers, this may be linked to the prices of hikes and funding system needed to take on a trip. 
This has a great effect on the number of trips taken and the duration of it. Subscribers takes longer and more trips than customers. 



## Key Insights for Presentation

> 1. Average trips duration (minutes and seconds) per month
> 2. Young people generally takes longer trips
> 3. Despite incomplete data for age and member gender, most of the rides were taken by the Male gender and Male subscribers.
